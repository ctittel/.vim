= My vim config

Currently contains:
- installation script for windows (installs the plugin vim-plug which is able to install other plugins directly from GitHub)
- installation of https://github.com/habamax/vim-asciidoctor[vim-asciidoctor] which is able to do AsciiDocotor code highlighting stuff 

== Installation
=== Step 1: Cloning of the directory
- Linux: clone directly into the home directory (`~`)
- Windows: clone into the user directory (`%userprofile%`) and rename the folder to `vimfiles`, then run the installation script `windows_install.ps1`

=== Step 2: Installation of plugins
- Open vim and run the command `:PlugInstall` to install the https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug[vim-plug] plugins
