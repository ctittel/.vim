= My vim config

Currently contains:
- installation script for windows (installs the plugin vim-plug which is able to install other plugins directly from GitHub)
- installation of https://github.com/habamax/vim-asciidoctor[vim-asciidoctor] which is able to do AsciiDocotor code highlighting stuff 

== Installation
- On Linux: clone directly into the home directory (`~`)
- On Windows: clone into the user directory (`%userprofile%`) and rename the folder to `vimfiles`, the run the installation script `windows_install.ps1`
